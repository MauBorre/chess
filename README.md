I made this project with a strict NO Google/AI/copy-pasted-code rule,
only Python's and Pygame's documentation, and 0 notion of how a Chess 
videogame could be made.

In addition to the game itself, my focus was also on crafting a reliable
menu/UI/HUD screen system, control input and game manager mechanisms that
I could reuse in future Pygame projects.

It only supports local Player vs. Player mode and it's a no-asset version.

`pip install pygame` <br>
`run python main.py`
