I made this project with a strict NO Google/AI/copy-pasted-code rule,
only Python's and Pygame's documentation, and 0 notion of how a Chess 
videogame could be made.

In addition to the game itself, my focus was also on crafting a reliable
menu/UI/HUD screen system, control input and game manager mechanisms that
I could reuse in future Pygame projects.

It only supports local Player vs. Player mode and it's a no-asset version,
but I wanted to share this milestone that may help others build their own
Chess game (I don't think I'll make it's full version source code
publicly available but will update the repo with a link to the game/store).

`pip install pygame` <br>
`run python main.py`
