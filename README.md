I made this project with a strict NO Google/AI/copy-pasted-code rule,
only Python's and Pygame's documentation, and 0 notion of how a Chess 
videogame could be made.

Beside the game itself, my focus was to also explore deeper into
crafting a reliable menu/UI/HUD system that I could reuse in future
Pygame projects.

It only supports Player vs. Player mode and it's a no-asset version.

pip install pygame
run python main.py
