This project was made with only Python's and Pygame's documentation. <br>
Absolute 0 reference from other chess / pygame projects and no notion of how to make
a game like this.

It only supports local Player vs. Player mode and it's a no-asset version.

`pip install pygame` <br>
`run python main.py`
